# Stages of Development

## Definitions

- POC: Proof of concept
  - The only deliverable is a proof that the product is possible.
  - Proof: Given constraints and requirements that we're aware of, demonstrate viability.
  - Possible: An application may be shipped free of defect and conforming to requirements.
- MVP: Minimum viable product
  - A product with enough features to attract customers in order to validate a product idea.
  - The product is of __production quality__ but contains only the minimum features.
- Full product
  - Not only must the product be useful but must be designed in such a way that its feature-set and user-base may be managed successfully by those on staff.

## Quality and Qualities

## POC

Quality can be largely ignored to the extent that it proves that the quality requirements of the later stages may be met. Implied here is that the readability is high enough that the team feels it is reviewable.

Examples of permissable corners to cut:

- Minimal tests, only those provide proof or accelerate development
- Work in progress abstractions, leaking is fine since we're just exploring the problem-space.

## Minimum Viable Product

The largest difference between proof of concept and MVP is quality, here it requires __production quality__. At this stage developers should aggressively reduce scope and continuously ask themselves: "Is this feature necessary to meet the requirements?"

## Full Product

At the full product stage development should have normalized somewhat. Rapid and sweeping changes should be a thing of the past. Tickets should come in, features get developed, tested, reviewed and shipped.
